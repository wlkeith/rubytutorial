#Ruby basics:
#Arrays


#Array in ruby:
address = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

#Built in array reverse method:
address.reverse!


#use repl to test this reverse method: repl.it
#stands for read, evaluate, print, loop
#provides dev environment for lots of different languages

#print arrray
p address


#print array at address location
p address[5]


#reverse the array
new_address = address.reverse!


#print the new array
p new_address
